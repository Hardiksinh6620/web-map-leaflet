# Keyboard Access

> Reconstructed portfolio material. Hardiksinh states this work was completed with AI assistance during 2025. The original Git history was unavailable, so the author date is an assigned milestone; the real assembly time remains in committer metadata.

## Role in the project

This note supports **web-map-leaflet**, a project focused on accessible browser mapping. It records the decisions and checks associated with **keyboard access** so the implementation can be reviewed independently rather than inferred from an output alone.

## Working procedure

1. Identify the input, expected type, coordinate reference system, units, spatial extent and time coverage.
2. Record the operation and every parameter that can materially change the result.
3. Run the smallest representative example first and retain the expected output.
4. Check missing values, empty geometries, duplicates, boundary cases and implausible measurements.
5. Compare the result with an alternative setting or a manual calculation where practical.
6. Separate observations supported by the output from assumptions or causal interpretations.

## Acceptance criteria

- The purpose of keyboard access is clear to another analyst.
- Inputs and transformations can be traced without relying on memory.
- Units and CRS choices are explicit wherever location or distance matters.
- Failure produces an actionable message instead of a plausible but misleading result.
- Tests or review steps cover a normal case and at least one edge case.
- Public examples contain no personal, restricted or licensed source data.

## Review boundary

Documentation does not prove that an unavailable source dataset or earlier environment can be reproduced exactly. It records the intended method, validation standard and interpretation boundary. Any later rerun should capture software versions, data checksums and differences from the archived result.
